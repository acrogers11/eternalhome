sarah and i have made a number of things over the last few years under the general feeling of Eternal Home, including stickers, t-shirts, and other small accessories. here are a few we've made:

these were mostly proof of concept, prototypical pieces. likely they'll end up dyed another color to breathe some new life into them.
