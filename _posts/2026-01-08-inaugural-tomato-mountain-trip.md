tomato mountain is a vision i had this past year. a beautiful mountain coming out of the sky covered in tomato plants dotting the sides of the rock and soil. it because the title for all of outdoor goings on, and anything gear related. someday i hope to find and summit tomato mountain. 

for now however i  wanted to make a quick post about the last tomato mountain trip to bolinas. we did in fact climb a mountain and ended up settling in a little campsite with a few other folks. a lot of beautiful hiking towards the beach and then back inland. it would be awesome to come back and get a reservation for point reyes, but hiking anywhere along the coast is beautful and interesting. this was back in october so i'd be curious to see what winter is like.
