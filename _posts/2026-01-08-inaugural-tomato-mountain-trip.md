tomato mountain is a vision i had this past year. a beautiful mountain coming out of the sky covered in tomato plants dotting the rock and soil. it became the category in my brain for all our outdoor goings on, and anything gear related. someday i hope to find and summit tomato mountain. 

for now however i  wanted to make a quick post about the last tomato mountain trip to bolinas. we did in fact climb a mountain and ended up settling in a little campsite with a few other folks. a lot of beautiful hiking towards the beach and then back inland. it would be awesome to come back and get a reservation for the beachfront sites, but hiking anywhere along the coast is beautful. this was back in october so i'd be curious to see what winter is like.

looking crusty and eating beans and rice and tortilla. would love to move away from using single use plastic bags eventually. what is the actual cost of a couple of extra grams for something more reuseable?

had to bust out this wicked outfit as well... surely sarah has pics on her device for her wicked fits too?

sarah: 

We got to what we thought was our site to gear strewn all around. As we hiked down to the coast we were indignant and offended that anyone could be in OUR reserved site. What a good reminder that we are wrong A LOT! And of the kindness of strangers. We met a couple that looked like very seasoned campers, nice ass gear and it looks as though they have been on a long trip. I remember she was reading a sappy page turning romance. They were kind and showed us the way to our real reserved site they even walked us to a map to lead us in the right direction. At this point Alex and I were starving and I remember having to climb up this huge hill and scarfing down a protein bar through labored breaths. It was the best thing I’ve ever eaten.

Before the whole ordeal. Absolutely gorgeous magical place.

We finally reached our site. We were trying out a new tent after our tent fail in the Santa Cruz mountains. I will say a huge improvement!

I don’t have many pictures of my own outfit but this trip urged me into buying a down lightweight jacket. I was freezing and had to borrow Alex’s but I do absolutely love this fleece neck warmer. I also use it while biking and it’s a game changer.
