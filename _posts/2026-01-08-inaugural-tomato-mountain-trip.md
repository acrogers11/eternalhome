tomato mountain is a vision i had this past year. a beautiful mountain coming out of the sky covered in tomato plants dotting the rock and soil. it became the category in my brain for all our outdoor goings on, and anything gear related. someday i hope to find and summit tomato mountain. 

for now however i  wanted to make a quick post about the last tomato mountain trip to bolinas. we did in fact climb a mountain and ended up settling in a little campsite with a few other folks. a lot of beautiful hiking towards the beach and then back inland. it would be awesome to come back and get a reservation for the beachfront sites, but hiking anywhere along the coast is beautful. this was back in october so i'd be curious to see what winter is like.
