**monday**

the rain has finally come to fall here in the city. the early spring we hoped for seems  deferred a bit further, so we took the forecast for a rare opportunity to test our rain gear, or perhaps our lack thereof. we decided what better way to get acquainted with our gear than on bikes. sarah writes: 

>As a child I loved to create mud pits in the backyard. I would take the hose and dig, then jump into what to me was an ecstasy of texture and sound. Dramatic yes, maybe, but it’s true. Biking off-road in the rain fills me with those similar childlike sensations.

so we drunk down our cups and started cruising through the west side of the city. salvation  army was a bust, but with lunar new year approaching, the businesses on clement were bustling. folks were lined up outside the meat shops for roasted duck, but we were able to get in and out of wheat field smoothly.

the buns weren't much to write home about, but i found the sponge cake *exactly* not too sweet. the matcha roll cake was... we don't talk about the matcha roll...

these buns, however, were of some significance...

onto the park we went! sarah:

>My bike journey is this: from single speed, to road, and finally gravel. I decided to finally take the Bridgestone out (with Alex’s guidance) off road around Golden Gate Park. I was nervous because it was rainy, *very rainy*, and I have nothing that is really fully waterproof.

>My rain jacket consists of an old Uniqlo puffer that Alex got me when I was 20 that now doesn’t fit my arm length. It works for a bit until it doesn’t. My shoes consist of the Merrells you always see on the rei sell back rack because people constantly return them. Why? I don’t really know. They’re ugly but not horrible, not fully waterproof but sufficiently so. I bought them and I will use them.

>My favorite of the gear has to be my new smart wool gloves that kept my hands very warm and aided in my handlebar grippage (is that a word?) They are taking a long time to dry though, it’s been a day and a half and they’re still wet but we also don’t have heat in our apartment. I wore my Ben Davis pants and a cafe nyleta beanie that I stole from Alex cause I like how tight it fits around my head. Anyways, this rainy day I learned that I still love playing in mud and I need to buy better rain clothes.

after riding around the park and exploring the awesome network of trails for quite some time we ended up in the botanical gardens to peep the blooming, fragrant magnolias.

after a few hours of riding we needed desperately to rest and munch on some snacks. while sarah was pretty wet on her upper half, i was soaked through to my chonies. riding around without fenders or waterproof pants proved exactly how you might expect: wet and uncomfortable.

i ended up shedding my flannel and wool cardigan (nepenthes of course) and just wore a t-shirt under the montbell storm cruiser as we were getting pretty warm from climbing some fun hills. the jansport and gorilla cuts were completely soaked through though... perhaps it's time for a new daypack. the jansport's held up very well though considering it's like 15 years old. more on that later too perhaps...

after our outing sarah wanted to look at the outdoor stores for an actual dedicated rain jacket, but the trips were kind of a bust. everything is so expensive at retail and nothing much spoke to her. more on that later.

the weather called for soup, and we responded.

**tuesday**

lunar new year is upon us at last! the lightning in the early morning and the sounds of firecrackers throughout the afternoon made me feel grateful for our beautiuful city. so begins the year of the horse!

after work i spent most of the afternoon in anticipation for a DHL box containing some tomato-mountain-related items from japan. i have a deep, sort of sad feeling about my own obsessive, at times compulsive consumption, but i was admittedly foaming a bit at the sight of this:

and while i won't spoil everything now because i think the contents of some of these envelopes will deserve their own posts when they get tested a bit, i will show off these delightful south2 west8 semi-fingerless gloves i think will be perfect for biking work in the morning, superflous logo aside:

**wednesday**

the morning greeted us with heavy rain. i heard rumors of hail throughout the morning but didn't see any myself. the rain did seem to stop by the time i left for work so i didn't pack anything waterproof, instead opting for a cheap collapsible umbrella. it did start raining again but not for too long, with the sun poking out around the middle of the day. by the time i was done with work it was too warm for my insulated jacket.

i've been thinking about waterproof shoes. i took the bus to REI to look at some used danner boots with high rubber walls that were light and stylish i remembered from my last visit. i tried them on but the insole just didn't feel right, and i was thinking about my own most waterproof shoes, a pair of late 70s danner mountain light boots with goretex lining, which get the job done just fine anyway... no need to consume any more. 

i did have a very drippy, functional fit though...

70s cons
and my little porter toolbag

i grabbed some dry beans from the folks at the downtown farmer's market as they were packing up, a slice of pizza, made a quick trip to grab some more groceries for the coming days, and completely escaped the rain.

**thursday**

while i did pack my rain jacket with me on the way to work, i didn't need it all. maybe the rain we were promised wasn't such a big deal anyway. it's been cold this week for sure, but nothinhg unbareable. i wore a wool baselayer and was actually too hot at work. go figure... nothing much else to report. i don't even remember any rain.

my buddy did pick up an extremely minty bridgestone MB-2 though. almost all the parts on it were original. mostyly though it got me stoked to go ride soon.

the highlight of the day was a delicious bean stew i have braising in the oven for hours. pork, a couple kinds of beans, tomatoes, topped with queso fresco was the perfect comfort dish for the cold, cold evening.

**friday**

yet another day without so much as a misting. so much for "a week of rain" huh? two days in a row without watery skies though did embolden me to bike after work. i've been itching to get back out there and have fun. i ate a choco pie from japantown and set off.

i watched someone on youtube recently talk about their 2000th ride up hawk hill, which seems kind of insane to me but did inspire me to get on up there. i crossed the bridge and started up the steepest pitch, and simply worked slowly the whole way up. it felt easier than the last time i did it, and being that it was twilighty and cold out i was completely alone for some segments which was amazing. i watched a container ship go by, a pair of deer jump the barriers down into the hills, and a truly gorgeous sunset.

the hills looked particularly majestic.

before i descended i had to enjoy a view of the bridge. it's just undeniable. sometimes i feel so full of gratitude.

bombing down was great. even better was riding home through the presidio and getting a second bomb down the 15th street gate. another perfect day. i'm already looking forward to the next supposed "week of rain."
