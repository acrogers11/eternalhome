**monday**

the rain has finally come to fall here in the city. the early spring we hoped for seems  deferred a bit further, so we took the forecast for a rare opportunity to test our rain gear, or perhaps our lack thereof. we decided what better way to get acquainted with our gear than on bikes. sarah writes: 

>As a child I loved to create mud pits in the backyard. I would take the hose and dig, then jump into what to me was an ecstasy of texture and sound. Dramatic yes, maybe, but it’s true. Biking off-road in the rain fills me with those similar childlike sensations.

so we drunk down our cups and started cruising through the west side of the city. salvation  army was a bust, but with lunar new year approaching, the businesses on clement were bustling. folks were lined up outside the meat shops for roasted duck, but we were able to get in and out of wheat field smoothly.

the buns weren't much to write home about, but i found the sponge cake *exactly* not too sweet. the matcha roll cake was... we don't talk about the matcha roll...

these buns, however, were of some significance...

onto the park we went! sarah:

>My bike journey is this: from single speed, to road, and finally gravel. I decided to finally take the Bridgestone out (with Alex’s guidance) off road around Golden Gate Park. I was nervous because it was rainy, *very rainy*, and I have nothing that is really fully waterproof.

>My rain jacket consists of an old Uniqlo puffer that Alex got me when I was 20 that now doesn’t fit my arm length. It works for a bit until it doesn’t. My shoes consist of the Merrells you always see on the rei sell back rack because people constantly return them. Why? I don’t really know. They’re ugly but not horrible, not fully waterproof but sufficiently so. I bought them and I will use them.

>My favorite of the gear has to be my new smart wool gloves that kept my hands very warm and aided in my handlebar grippage (is that a word?) They are taking a long time to dry though, it’s been a day and a half and they’re still wet but we also don’t have heat in our apartment. I wore my Ben Davis pants and a cafe nyleta beanie that I stole from Alex cause I like how tight it fits around my head. Anyways, this rainy day I learned that I still love playing in mud and I need to buy better rain clothes.

after riding around the park and exploring the awesome network of trails for quite some time we ended up in the botanical gardens to peep the blooming, fragrant magnolias.

after a few hours of riding we needed desperately to rest and munch on some snacks. while sarah was pretty wet on her upper half, i was soaked through to my chonies. riding around without fenders or waterproof pants proved exactly how you might expect: wet and uncomfortable.

i ended up shedding my flannel and wool cardigan (nepenthes of course) and just wore a t-shirt under the montbell storm cruiser as we were getting pretty warm from climbing some fun hills. the jansport and gorilla cuts were completely soaked through though... perhaps it's time for a new daypack. the jansport's held up very well though considering it's like 15 years old. more on that later too perhaps...

after our outing sarah wanted to look at the outdoor stores for an actual dedicated rain jacket, but the trips were kind of a bust. everything is so expensive at retail and nothing much spoke to her. more on that later.

the weather called for soup, and we responded.

**tuesday**

lunar new year is upon us at last! the lightning in the early morning and the sounds of firecrackers throughout the afternoon made me feel grateful for our beautiuful city. so begins the year of the horse!

after work i spent most of the afternoon in anticipation for a DHL box containing some tomato-mountain-related items from japan. i have a deep, sort of sad feeling about my own obsessive, at times compulsive consumption, but i was admittedly foaming a bit at the sight of this:

and while i won't spoil everything now because i think the contents of some of these envelopes will deserve their own posts when they get tested a bit, i will show off these delightful south2 west8 semi-fingerless gloves i think will be perfect for biking work in the morning, superflous logo aside:
