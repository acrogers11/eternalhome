south2 west8 doesn't get a ton of love in the states, not even close to needles or engineered garments, despite having the same parent company. their designs are a good mix of both of those brands though, at times as garish and confounding as needles, and simultaneously as functional as the military detailing in EG. it's a totally unique combo, tailored t0 the stream, the trail, and the saddle. i think too that the western aversion to them also comes from the price, with US retailers making them kind of impossible to get domestically. i would recommend getting them through an auction site or getting them proxied, though with the abolition of the de minimis exemption, all of my favorite stuff is just that much more inaccesible... *djpetesake voice* i thought this wasn't a social commentary! 

the older garments are awesome but always cut way too small for me, but the quality has stayed top notch as with all the other nepenthes garments as the brand has gone on. they manufacture in japan for most of the technical style garments, europe for some older styles of knitwear, and in india for some of their brushed cotton pieces. but since this is tomato mountain, we'll be focused on the functional garments made in japan. i have a few other style from them i've collected over the years but to kick off this series on writing about gear, we'll start with the bush crew.

the south2 west8 bush crew is a lightweight, fully polyester, and semi-sheer top with elastic cuffs and an adjustable elastic hem. the fabric is one that they use for a few other styles, including an elastic waist pant, and a hooded jacket. south2 west8 also uses a heavyweight mesh for a few other styles, but i've only had firsthand expereince with the lightweight material. it's been a mainstay for the last few sping/summer seasons and has come in a variety of prints. i wear my tie-dye and leopard print ones all the time.

super breathable, it feels good to just have a little extra barrier between me and the wind when i'm running or biking, but when it's just chilly enough to want more than just a t-shirt. the material is super light but strong. i've fallen both while biking and running in there shirts and they haven't ripped with abrasion on dirt or rock. one has a small hole from when it got snagged on something long ago, but other than that they've been great. also by nature of the material, they're quick drying and have never been through a dry cycle.

it goes without saying that these look awesome with a graphic tee underneath. they accesorize well under an oversized tee, and also over a cotton crew. in general though, i find the best use case is with a t-shirt. 

i think two is more than enough for me, but if a good camo ever comes around at a good price i could see myself picking one more up.
